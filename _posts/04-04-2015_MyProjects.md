# My Projects

Here are some of my latest projects:

1. **Data Scraping and Streamlit** - The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Stream lit Application" aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by providing a
   comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of detailed
   information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. By streamlining data collection and providing powerful tools for data-driven
   decision-making, this project can significantly improve operational efficiency and strategic planning in the transportation industry. [![GitHub Repository Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/github.png)](https://github.com/Ranjiny/Capstone1_Redbus)
2. **Time Series Forecasting** - This project aims to develop a predictive model that uses historical sales data and ingredient information to forecast future sales. This will enable Dominos to generate accurate purchase orders, ensuring optimal stock levels, reducing waste, and preventing stockouts.[![GitHub Repository Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/github.png)](https://github.com/Ranjiny/Capstone5_DominosPrediction)
3. **Uploaded Image Emotion Detection** - The goal is to develop a Streamlit-based application that enables users to upload an image, which will then be processed to detect the emotion of the person in the image using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).[![GitHub Repository Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/github.png](https://github.com/Ranjiny/Emotion-Detection-from-Uploaded-Images)
